## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

Working with the dataset “medical expenses” will hopefully allow us to expand our knowledge in the field of our future medical bills. Out of the several examples given to us, this one stood out to us, because with this analytics project, we are hoping to learn if certain factors like higher BMI or smoking corresponds to more or less money spent on healthcare. We are interested in this topic because we are curious to see if age or sex can determine the fluctuations in medical bills. For example age plays a factor because, elderly people sometimes need more medical attention compared to young adults. Some specific question we would like to explore is what. Some other example questions we can ask is “Can we plot the regions with the oldest population and highest charges?” or “How to compare peoples BMI to the sex and age”. Yes, we can imagine building a user-facing dashboard with this dataset.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

As a Canadian privy to paying very minimally for healthcare it is important to consider the greater cost of the services. The data was provided by the instructor. The data was used in a introduction to machine learning book. This data set includes age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoker status, region and the charges billed by health insurance. It is hard to pin down an exact date on the data, but due to the book referencing the data being released in october 25th 2013 we can assume the data is at least 7 years old. Given that the dataset is based off of the USA medical system it is safe the assume the charges would be far greater than in Canada. Knowing how relative to BMI and smoking status the costs change will help give an understanding to the variance in charges. Moreover, the difference in regions smoker % or average age could all share correlation with charges. The purpose of the dataset is to show through various inquiries involving medical costs what is a plausible correlation or not.
