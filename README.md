## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

Working with the dataset “medical expenses” will hopefully allow us to expand our knowledge in the field of our future medical bills. Out of the several examples given to us, this one stood out to us, because with this analytics project, we are hoping to learn if certain factors like higher BMI or smoking corresponds to more or less money spent on healthcare. We are interested in this topic because we are curious to see if age or sex can determine the fluctuations in medical bills. For example age plays a factor because, elderly people sometimes need more medical attention compared to young adults. Some specific question we would like to explore is what. Some other example questions we can ask is “Can we plot the regions with the oldest population and highest charges?” or “How to compare peoples BMI to the sex and age”. Yes, we can imagine building a user-facing dashboard with this dataset.
